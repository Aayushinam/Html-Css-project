                            Hi, I’m Keshav, and my life is screwed.I hate my job and my girlfriend left me. <br>
Ah, the beautiful Zara. From Kashmir. A Muslim. And did I tell you my family is a bit, well traditional? Anyway, leave that.
<br>
Zara and I broke up three years ago. She moved on in life. I didn’t. I drank every night to forget her. I called, messaged, stalked. She just ignored me.
<br>
However, that night, on the eve of her birthday, Zara messaged me.
She called me over, like old times, to her hostel room 105.
I shouldn’t have gone, but I did … and my life changed forever.

                        <p>In India Positive, bestselling author and columnist Chetan Bhagat brings together essays that work as a manifesto for change. Examining a gamut of subjects—from education to employment, from GST to infrastructure, from corruption to casteism—Bhagat reflects on what we can do right in order to move forward and become a truly modern, progressive country.
                            He expresses in these pages his belief that, if we want to see reform, we—as citizens—need to be the solution. If our country is to shine, Bhagat says, we need to stand up and be ‘India Positive Citizens’.
                            
                            In a world ridden with negativity, these simply written, perceptive and solution-driven essays are a must-read for anyone invested in the present and future of India.

                        <p>Five Point Someone is a story about three friends in IIT who are unable to cope.

                            The book starts with a disclaimer, “This is not a book to teach you how to get into IIT or even how to live in college. In fact, it describes how screwed up things can get if you don’t think straight.”
                            
                            Three hostelmates – Alok, Hari and Ryan get off to a bad start in IIT – they screw up the first class quiz. And while they try to make amends, things only get worse. It takes them a while to realize: If you try and screw with the IIT system, it comes back to double screw you. Before they know it, they are at the lowest echelons of IIT society. They have a five-point-something GPA out of ten, ranking near the end of their class. This GPA is a tattoo that will remain with them, and come in the way of anything else that matters – their friendship, their future, their love life. While the world expects IITians to conquer the world, these guys are struggling to survive.

                        <p>In late-2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad called Govind dreamt of having a business. To accomodate his friends Ish and Omi’s passion, they open a cricket shop. Govind wants to make money and thinks big.  Ish is all about nurturing Ali, the batsman with a rare gift. Omi knows his limited capabiltiies and just wants to be with his friends. However, nothing comes easy in a turbulent city. To realize their goals, they will have to face it all – religious politics, earthquakes, riots, unacceptable love  and above all,  their own mistakes. Will they make it? Can an individual’s dreams overcome the nightmares offered by real life? Can we succeed despite a few mistakes?

                            Based on real events, from the bestselling author of “Five Point Someone” and “One Night @ the call centre”, comes another dark, witty tale about modern India.

                        <p>Hi, I’m Radhika Mehta and I’m getting married this week.
                            I work at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Thank you for reading my story. However, let me warn you. You may not like much.
                            One, I make a lot of money.
                            Two, I have an opinion on everything.
                            Three, I have had a boyfriend before. OK, maybe two.
                            Now if I were a guy, you’d be cool with it. Since I am a girl, these things don’t make me likeable, do they?
